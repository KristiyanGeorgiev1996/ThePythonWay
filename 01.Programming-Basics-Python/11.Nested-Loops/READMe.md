# Nested Loops – Programming Basics with Python 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Nested Loops** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in Python as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: Clock  
**Description:**  
Create a program that outputs every minute of a full day, starting at 00:00 and ending at 23:59. Each time should be displayed on its own line in the format "{hour}:{minute}".

---

### 📝 Task 2: Multiplication Table  
**Description:**  
Generate and print the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10. Each line should show the multiplication expression and its result like this:  
"{first number} * {second number} = {product}".

---

### 📝 Task 3: Combinations  
**Description:**  
Calculate the number of possible triples of non-negative integers (including zero) whose sum equals a user-provided integer n.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Sum of Two Numbers  
**Description:**  
Given a numeric range and a target "magic" number, examine all pairs of numbers within the range. Your program should find the first pair whose sum equals the target. If found, display the combination number and the pair. If no such pair exists, indicate the total combinations tested and that none matched the sum.

**Input:**  
- Starting number of the range (integer between 1 and 999)  
- Ending number of the range (integer ≥ start and ≤ 1000)  
- The target magic number (integer between 1 and 10,000)  

**Output:**  
- If a matching pair is found:  
  "Combination N:{combination number} ({first number} + {second number} = {magic number})"  
- If no pair matches:  
  "{total combinations} combinations - neither equals {magic number}"

### 📝 Task 5: Travel  
**Description:**  
Ani wants to visit multiple destinations during the year. For each destination, she inputs the place name and the minimum budget needed. She then accumulates savings until she reaches or surpasses that budget, at which point the program announces her travel to that destination. The process continues until "End" is entered, signaling no more travel plans.

### 📝 Task 6: Building  
**Description:**  
Design a program that prints the labels of rooms in a building, starting from the highest floor down to the ground floor, based on the following rules:

- Even-numbered floors contain only offices, labeled as "O{floor}{officeNumber}" starting at 0.  
- Odd-numbered floors contain apartments, labeled as "A{floor}{apartmentNumber}" starting at 0.  
- The top floor has larger apartments labeled with "L" instead of "A".  
- If the building has only one floor, it will only contain large apartments.

**Input:**  
Two integers representing the number of floors and the number of rooms per floor.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
