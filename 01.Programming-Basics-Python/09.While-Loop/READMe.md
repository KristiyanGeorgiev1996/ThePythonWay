# While Loop – Programming Basics with Python 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **While Loop** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in Python as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: Reading Input Until "Stop"  
**Description:**  
Create a program that continuously reads lines of text from the console and prints each line. The program should stop reading and exit when the input is exactly "Stop".

---

### 📝 Task 2: User Login  
**Description:**  
Write a program that first reads a username and a password. Then, it repeatedly asks the user to enter a password for login.

- If the entered password is incorrect, prompt the user to try again.
- When the correct password is entered, display the message: "Welcome {username}!".

---

### 📝 Task 3: Summation Until Limit  
**Description:**  
Develop a program that reads an integer `limit` from the user. Then, keep reading integers, summing them up, until the total sum reaches or exceeds `limit`. Finally, print the resulting sum.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Print Sequence 2k + 1  
**Description:**  
Write a program that reads an integer `n` and prints all numbers in the sequence defined by the formula `number = previous_number * 2 + 1` starting from 1, which are less than or equal to `n`.

Example sequence: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ...

### 📝 Task 5: Account Balance Calculator  
**Description:**  
Create a program that reads deposits until it encounters the command "NoMoreMoney".

- If a deposit is a negative number, print "Invalid operation!" and stop reading further input.
- Otherwise, accumulate the deposits.
- After finishing, print the total balance formatted to two decimal places with the prefix "Total: ".

### 📝 Task 6: Find the Largest Number  
**Description:**  
Write a program that continuously reads integer numbers from the user until the command "Stop" is received. The program should then output the largest number entered.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Find the Smallest Number  
**Description:**  
Similar to Task 6, but this time find and print the smallest number entered before the "Stop" command.

---

### 📝 Task 8: Student Graduation Average  
**Description:**  
Develop a program to calculate a student’s average grade across 12 school years.

- First, read the student’s name.
- Then, read grades for each year.
- If the student receives a grade below 4.00 more than once, they are excluded. The program should stop and print the student's name along with the year they were excluded.
- If the student successfully passes all 12 years, print:  
  "{student name} graduated. Average grade: {average}"

Grades should be shown with two decimal points precision.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
