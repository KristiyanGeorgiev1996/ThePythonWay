# Conditional Statements – Programming Basics with Python 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Conditional Statements** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in Python as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Overview of Tasks:

### 📝 Task 1: Outstanding Grade Check  
**Task Description:**  
Create a console application that accepts a grade (a floating-point value) from the user. If the grade is 5.50 or higher, print the message: "Excellent!".

---

### 📝 Task 2: Find the Larger Number  
**Task Description:**  
Write a program that reads two integers from the user and outputs the larger of the two values.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Determine Even or Odd  
**Task Description:**  
Write a program which takes an integer input and displays whether the number is even or odd.

- Print "even" if the number is divisible by 2.  
- Print "odd" if it is not.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Password Verification  
**Task Description:**  
Develop a program that reads a password string from the user and compares it against the exact phrase "s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd".

- If the input matches exactly, output: "Welcome".  
- Otherwise, output: "Wrong password!".

---

### 📝 Task 5: Number Range Check  
**Task Description:**  
Create a program that reads an integer and checks which interval it falls into:

- If the number is less than 100, print: "Less than 100"  
- If the number is between 100 and 200 (inclusive), print: "Between 100 and 200"  
- If the number is greater than 200, print: "Greater than 200"

---

### 📝 Task 6: Speed Classification  
**Task Description:**  
Write a program that takes a real number representing speed and classifies it according to the following categories:

- Speed up to 10 (inclusive): print "slow"  
- Speed greater than 10 up to 50 (inclusive): print "average"  
- Speed greater than 50 up to 150 (inclusive): print "fast"  
- Speed greater than 150 up to 1000 (inclusive): print "ultra fast"  
- Speed exceeding 1000: print "extremely fast"

---

### 📝 Task 7: Calculate Area of a Shape  
**Task Description:**  
Write a program that reads the type of a geometric shape and its dimensions, then calculates its area. The supported shapes are: square, rectangle, circle, and triangle.

Input details:  
- For a square, read one floating-point number representing the length of its side.  
- For a rectangle, read two floating-point numbers representing the lengths of its two sides.  
- For a circle, read one floating-point number representing its radius.  
- For a triangle, read two floating-point numbers: the length of the base and the corresponding height.

The output should be the area, rounded to three decimal places.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
