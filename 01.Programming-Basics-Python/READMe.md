# Programming Basics with JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from the **Programming Basics with C#** course at SoftUni, which I am re-solving in Python to practice the language and programming concepts.

The course is designed for beginners and provides a solid introduction to programming concepts using the C# language. It builds a foundation for further studies in software development and prepares students for the entry exam to the Software Engineering program.

## Topics Covered

- Variables and data types
- Console input and output
- Basic operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (if, if-else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Nested conditions and nested loops
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations

## Skills Acquired

- Reading input from and printing output to the console
- Using loops to automate repetitive tasks
- Applying conditional logic for decision-making
- Creating nested condition structures
- Performing calculations and processing data
- Writing nested loops for more complex logic

## Notes

All tasks have been rewritten and solved entirely in Python.

Each folder contains:
- A solution file (`.py`)
- Example input/output where applicable
- A README file with task descriptions, rephrased and clearly summarized.
