# While Loop - Exercise – Programming Basics with Python 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **While Loop - Exercise** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in Python as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: The Old Library  
**Problem Statement:**  
Ani returns home and looks for her favorite book in her grandmother’s old library. The program reads the name of the book Ani is searching for (string). Then it reads the names of books one by one until Ani finds her book or all books are checked. The process stops when the command "No More Books" is received.

- If the book is not found, print two lines:  
  "The book you search is not here!"  
  "You checked {number} books."
- If the book is found, print:  
  "You checked {number} books and found it."

### 📝 Task 2: Exam Preparation  
**Problem Statement:**  
Marin solves exam tasks and receives grades until he gets the "Enough" command or reaches a limit of failing grades (grades ≤ 4). The first input is the allowed number of failing grades (1 to 5), followed by task names and their grades.

**Output:**  
- If "Enough" is received, print:  
  "Average score: {average}"  
  "Number of problems: {total tasks}"  
  "Last problem: {last task name}"
- If failing grades limit is reached, print:  
  "You need a break, {number} poor grades."

The average is formatted to two decimal places.

### 📝 Task 3: Holiday Savings  
**Problem Statement:**  
Jesse tries to save money for a holiday by saving or spending daily. If Jesse spends more than available, her money drops to zero.

**Input:**  
- Needed amount for holiday (real number)  
- Initial money available (real number)  
- Multiple lines with action ("spend" or "save") and amount (real number)

**Output:**  
- If Jesse spends money 5 days in a row, print:  
  "You can't save the money."  
  "{total days}"
- If she saves enough, print:  
  "You saved the money for {total days} days."

### 📝 Task 4: Steps Goal  
**Problem Statement:**  
Gabi wants to walk 10,000 steps per day. She inputs steps taken multiple times per day. If she wants to go home early, she enters "Going home" and inputs the steps walked back home.

**Output:**  
- If goal reached, print:  
  "Goal reached! Good job!"  
  "{extra steps} steps over the goal."
- Otherwise, print:  
  "{remaining steps} more steps to reach goal."

### 📝 Task 5: Coins  
**Problem Statement:**  
Given an amount of change, calculate the minimum number of coins needed to return it.

### 📝 Task 6: Cake  
**Problem Statement:**  
At a birthday party, guests take pieces of a cake with given width and length. Read the number of pieces taken until the command "STOP" or the cake runs out.

**Output:**  
- If cake pieces remain after "STOP", print:  
  "{pieces left} pieces are left."
- If cake runs out, print:  
  "No more cake left! You need {pieces missing} pieces more."

### 📝 Task 7: Moving  
**Problem Statement:**  
Jose moves into a new apartment. The apartment’s free space dimensions (width, length, height) are given. Boxes are moved in one by one until the command "Done" or until space runs out.

**Output:**  
- If space remains after "Done", print:  
  "{free space} Cubic meters left."
- If space runs out before "Done", print:  
  "No more free space! You need {missing space} Cubic meters more."
