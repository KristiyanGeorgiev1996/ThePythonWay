## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🪨✂️📄 01. Rock Paper Scissors – Additional Project  
A console-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user competes against the computer.

**Highlights:**
- Utilizes the `Random` class for opponent moves  
- Applies conditional logic (`if-else`, `switch`)  
- Manages user input and output effectively  

---

### 🔢 02. Guess a Number – Additional Project  
A number-guessing game where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it, receiving hints on each attempt.

**Highlights:**
- Random number generation  
- Loop and conditional control structures  
- Input validation and feedback handling  

---

### 📝 03. Random Sentences Generator – Additional Project  
A simple program that generates random, funny sentences by combining elements from predefined arrays.

**Highlights:**
- Array manipulation (`string[]`)  
- Random index selection  
- Logic separation into reusable methods
