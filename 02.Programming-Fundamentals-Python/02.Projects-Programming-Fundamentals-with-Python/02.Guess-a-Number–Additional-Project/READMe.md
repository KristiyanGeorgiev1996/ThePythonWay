# 🎯 Guess the Number Game (Python)

![Guess A Number](../Images/guess-the-number.png)

## 📝 Description

A simple Python console application where the computer secretly picks a number within a certain range, and the player’s objective is to find it by guessing.  
After each attempt, the program gives feedback whether the target number is greater or smaller than the guess.  
The game continues until the correct number is found.

## 📖 Game Concept

1. The computer generates a hidden number within a given range (e.g., 1–100).
2. The player enters guesses and receives hints:
   - If the guess is too low → the program indicates “higher”.
   - If the guess is too high → the program indicates “lower”.
3. The game ends when the number is guessed correctly.
4. Players can choose to start a new round after winning.

## 🎯 Core Requirements

- **Random Number Generation:** Pick a number between 1 and 100 (or different range for other levels).  
- **Player Input:** Read and validate the guessed number.  
- **Hints:** Indicate whether the secret number is higher or lower than the guess.  
- **Input Validation:** Handle invalid entries with an error message.  
- **Replay Option:** After a correct guess, ask if the player wants to play again.  
- **Level Progression:** Higher levels can increase the range.  
- **Attempt Tracking:** Count how many guesses are made per round.  
- **Code Structure:** Keep logic organized and separated into methods.
