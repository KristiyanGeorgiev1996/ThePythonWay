# Arrays – Programming Fundamentals with Python 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Arrays** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Day of the Week  
**Description:**  
Input a number between 1 and 7 and display the corresponding day of the week. If the number is outside this range, print "Invalid day!". Use a string array to store the days.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Print Numbers in Reverse  
**Description:**  
Read an integer n and then read n numbers from the console. Print these numbers in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Hint: Start by reading the count n.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Rounding Numbers  
**Description:**  
Read a sequence of real numbers separated by spaces, round each number away from zero, and output the rounded results.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Reverse Array of Strings  
**Description:**  
Create a program that reads a series of strings separated by spaces, reverses their order, and prints them on a single line separated by spaces.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Sum of Even Numbers  
**Description:**  
Read an array of integers from the console and calculate the sum of all even numbers in it.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Difference Between Even and Odd Sums  
**Description:**  
Write a program that computes the difference between the sum of even numbers and the sum of odd numbers in an array.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Compare Arrays for Equality  
**Description:**  
Read two arrays and check if they are identical. Two arrays are identical if all their corresponding elements match.  
If they are identical, print:  
`"Arrays are identical. Sum: {sum}"`  
where `{sum}` is the total sum of elements from one of the arrays.  
If not, find and print the first index where they differ:  
`"Arrays are not identical. Found difference at {index} index"`

---

### 📝 Task 8: Condense Array to a Single Number  
**Description:**  
Read an array of integers and repeatedly condense it by summing each pair of adjacent elements until only one number remains.  

Example:  
Given `{2, 10, 3}`, first sum pairs to get `{12, 13}`, then sum those to get `{25}`.

Hint:  
While the array has more than one element:  
- Create a new array one element shorter.  
- Fill it with sums of adjacent pairs from the current array.  
- Replace the current array with the new one.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
