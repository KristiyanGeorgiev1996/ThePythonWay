# Programming Fundamentals with Python - Solved Tasks

This file contains a collection of tasks that have been solved as part of the **Programming Fundamentals with C#** course. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language. The tasks have contributed to strengthening the understanding of fundamental programming concepts and C# syntax.

## Technologies and Topics Covered:

During the course, the following core programming concepts have been explored:

- **Language Comparison and Basic Syntax**  
  An exploration of syntax differences between various programming languages and a solid understanding of C# syntax.

- **Conditional Statements and Loops**  
  Hands-on experience with conditional operators such as `if-else`, `switch-case`, and various loop types (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).

- **Data Types and Variables**  
  Work with different data types (integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.) and understanding how to declare and initialize variables effectively.

- **Arrays**  
  Creation and manipulation of arrays, including reading inputs from the console, accessing array elements, and performing various operations on arrays.

- **Methods**  
  Definition of methods, passing parameters, and returning values. Additionally, method overloading has been explored, along with method signatures.

- **Lists**  
  Usage of dynamic arrays (lists) to store, modify, and process data, including operations such as adding, removing, and inserting elements.

- **Objects and Classes**  
  Definition and use of classes and objects, along with fundamental object-oriented programming principles such as constructors, methods, and properties.

- **Associative Arrays (Dictionaries)**  
  Work with associative arrays (key-value pairs), including storing and retrieving data from them.

- **Text Processing**  
  Manipulation of strings, concatenation, splitting, and performing other common string operations.

- **Regular Expressions**  
  Understanding and utilizing regular expressions for pattern matching, string validation, and data extraction.

## Overview of Solved Tasks:

The tasks are structured to reinforce each of the aforementioned concepts. The individual tasks can be reviewed in this repository to see how these concepts have been applied to solve practical problems.
