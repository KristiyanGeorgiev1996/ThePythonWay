# 🧑‍💻 Methods – Programming Fundamentals with Python

This folder contains tasks from the **Methods** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in Python as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: Sign of Integer Numbers  
**Description:**  
Given an integer, create a method that determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. Print the result as follows:

- If positive: `"The number {number} is positive."`  
- If negative: `"The number {number} is negative."`  
- If zero: `"The number {number} is zero."`

### 📝 Task 2: Grades  
**Description:**  
Create a method that accepts a grade between 2.00 and 6.00 and prints its corresponding grade description:

- 2.00 – 2.99 → `"Fail"`  
- 3.00 – 3.49 → `"Poor"`  
- 3.50 – 4.49 → `"Good"`  
- 4.50 – 5.49 → `"Very good"`  
- 5.50 – 6.00 → `"Excellent"`

### 📝 Task 3: Calculations  
**Description:**  
Write a program that reads three inputs:

1. A command string: `"add"`, `"multiply"`, `"subtract"`, or `"divide"`  
2. A number  
3. Another number  

Implement four separate methods for these operations. Call the method that matches the command, and print the result inside the method (void return type).

### 📝 Task 4: Printing Triangle  
**Description:**  
Create a method that prints a triangle pattern.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Orders  
**Description:**  
Write a method that calculates and prints the total price of an order. The method takes two parameters:

- Product name as a string: `"coffee"`, `"water"`, `"coke"`, `"snacks"`  
- Quantity as an integer  

Prices per item:  
- Coffee: 1.50  
- Water: 1.00  
- Coke: 1.40  
- Snacks: 2.00  

Print the total price rounded to two decimal places.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Calculate Rectangle Area  
**Description:**  
Create a method that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle, given its width and height.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Repeat String  
**Description:**  
Create a method that accepts two parameters:  
- A string  
- An integer n  

Return a new string consisting of the original string repeated n times consecutively (without spaces).

---

### 📝 Task 8: Math Power  
**Description:**  
Create a method that takes two numbers:  
- Base  
- Exponent  

Return the base raised to the power of the exponent.

---

### 📝 Task 9: Greater of Two Values  
**Description:**  
Given two inputs of the same type (`int`, `char`, or `string`), implement overloaded methods named `GetMax()` to return the greater of the two values.

---

### 📝 Task 10: Multiply Evens by Odds  
**Description:**  
Create a program that multiplies the sum of all even digits of a number by the sum of all odd digits of the same number. Implement three methods:

- `GetMultipleOfEvenAndOdds()`  
- `GetSumOfEvenDigits()`  
- `GetSumOfOddDigits()`  

Note: Consider using `Math.Abs()` for handling negative numbers.

---

### 📝 Task 11: Math Operations  
**Description:**  
Write a method that receives two numbers and an operator, performs the operation, and returns the result. Input will be:

1. First number  
2. Operator (`/`, `*`, `+`, or `-`)  
3. Second number

Return the calculated result.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
