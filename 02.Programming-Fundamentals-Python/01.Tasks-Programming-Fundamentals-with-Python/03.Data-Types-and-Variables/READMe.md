# 🧑‍💻 Data Types and Variables – Programming Fundamentals with Python

This repository contains tasks from the **Data Types and Variables** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: Convert Meters to Kilometers

**Description:**  
Write a program that reads a distance in meters and converts it to kilometers.  
The result should be formatted to **two decimal places**.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Pounds to Dollars

**Description:**  
Create a program that converts British Pounds to US Dollars.  
Use the conversion rate:  
> 1 British Pound = 1.31 US Dollars  
Format the result to **three decimal places**.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Exact Sum of Real Numbers

**Description:**  
Write a program that reads `n` real numbers and calculates their **exact total sum** without rounding errors.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Centuries to Minutes

**Description:**  
Create a program that reads an integer representing centuries and converts them into:
- years  
- days (use average year: 365.2422 days)  
- hours  
- minutes

Use appropriate data types to handle large values.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Special Numbers

**Description:**  
A number is considered *special* if the sum of its digits is **5, 7, or 11**.  
Write a program that reads an integer `n` and prints for every number from 1 to `n` whether it is special.

**Output Format Example:**  
`2 -> False`
`5 -> True`

> 💡 Tip: Use loops and digit extraction techniques to sum digits.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Reversed Characters

**Description:**  
Read **three characters**, one by one, from the input.  
Then print them in **reversed order**, separated by spaces.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Concatenate Names

**Description:**  
Create a program that reads two names and a delimiter, then prints the result of joining the names with the delimiter between them.

**Example:**  
`Input: John, Smith, ->`
`Output: John->Smith`

---

### 📝 Task 8: Town Information

**Description:**  
Read input for:  
- Town name (string)  
- Population (integer)  
- Area in square kilometers (integer)

Print the following formatted message:  
`Town {town name} has population of {population} and area {area} square km.`

---

### 📝 Task 9: Characters to String

**Description:**  
Read **three characters**, one per line, combine them into a single string, and print the result.

---

### 📝 Task 10: Lowercase or Uppercase

**Description:**  
Write a program that reads a **single character** and determines whether it is **uppercase** or **lowercase**.

**Example:**  
`Input: a → Output: lowercase`
`Input: Z → Output: uppercase`

---

### 📝 Task 11: Refactor Pyramid Volume Calculation

**Description:**  
Improve the readability and maintainability of the given code by:

- Replacing vague variable names (e.g., `dul`, `sh`, `V`)
- Declaring variables only when needed
- Avoiding reuse of the same variable for multiple purposes

**Goal:**  
Refactor the logic that reads dimensions and calculates the volume of a pyramid using:  
`volume = (length × width × height) / 3`

---

### 📝 Task 12: Refactor Special Numbers

**Description:**  
Refactor the solution from *Task 5* with focus on:

- Clear and meaningful variable names  
- Avoiding reassigning loop variables  
- Improving logic readability  

Make the code easier to read and maintain, while keeping the same functionality.

---

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
