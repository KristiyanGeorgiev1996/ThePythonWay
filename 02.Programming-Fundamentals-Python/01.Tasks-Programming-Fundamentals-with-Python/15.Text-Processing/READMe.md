# Text Processing – Programming Fundamentals with Python 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Text Processing** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

---

### 📝 Task 1: Reverse Strings  
**Problem Description:**  
You will receive multiple strings until the command `"end"` is entered.  
Write a program that reverses each string and prints it.

**Output Format:**  
`"{word} = {reversedWord}"`

---

### 📝 Task 2: Repeat Strings  
**Problem Description:**  
Read a list of strings. For each string, repeat it **N** times, where **N** is the length of the string.  
Print all repeated strings concatenated together.

**Example:**  
Input: `hi abc add`  
Output: `hihiaaaabbbccccaddaddadd`

### 📝 Task 3: Substring  
**Problem Description:**  
Receive two strings:  
- The first string is the substring to remove.  
- The second string is the base text.

Remove **all occurrences** of the first string from the second string repeatedly until none remain. Then print the resulting text.

**Input Example:**  
`ice`
`kicegiciceeb`


**Output:**  
`kgb`

### 📝 Task 4: Text Filter  
**Problem Description:**  
Read a list of banned words (comma and space separated) and a text block.  
Replace every banned word in the text with asterisks (`*`) matching the banned word’s length.

**Input Example:**  
`Linux, Windows`
`It is not recommended to use Linux or Windows.`


**Output:**  
`It is not recommended to use ***** or *******.`

### 📝 Task 5: Digits, Letters and Others  
**Problem Description:**  
Given a single string, separate its characters into three groups:  
- Digits  
- Letters  
- Other characters

Print each group on a separate line.

**Example Input:**  
`C@t1sC00l!`

**Example Output:**  
`100`
`CtsC`
`@!l`

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
