# Data Types and Variables - Exercise – Programming Fundamentals with Python 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Data Types and Variables - Exercise** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Integer Operations  
Write a program that takes four integer inputs. Perform these steps in order:  
- Add the first number to the second.  
- Divide the result by the third number using integer division.  
- Multiply the result by the fourth number.  
Print the final result.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Sum of Digits  
Write a program that reads an integer and calculates the sum of its digits.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Elevator Capacity  
Given the number of people `n` and elevator capacity `p`, calculate the minimum number of elevator trips needed to carry all people.  
Hint: Round up the division `n / p`.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Sum of ASCII Codes  
Read an integer `n` followed by `n` characters. Calculate and print the sum of the ASCII values of all characters.

---

### 📝 Task 5: ASCII Table Part Printer  
Read two integers representing start and end indexes. Print all ASCII characters in the inclusive range between these indexes.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Triplets of Latin Letters  
Given an integer `n`, print all possible triplets formed by the first `n` lowercase Latin letters, in alphabetical order.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Water Tank Overflow  
You have a water tank with capacity 255 liters. Read `n` liters of water amounts and pour each into the tank. If an amount exceeds available capacity, print `"Insufficient capacity!"` and skip it. At the end, print total water in the tank.

---

### 📝 Task 8: Biggest Beer Keg  
You will receive data about `n` beer kegs, each described by a model name, radius (float), and height (int). Calculate the volume using `π * r² * h` for each keg, and print the model with the largest volume.

---

### 📝 Task 9: Spice Mining  
A spice source yields an initial amount of spice. Each day the yield decreases by 10. Mining continues while the yield is at least 100. Each day, 26 units of spice are consumed by workers, and after mining ends, another 26 units are consumed (not exceeding stored spice). Calculate total mined spice and number of mining days.

---

### 📝 Task 10: Pokemon Poking  
A Pokemon starts with power `N`. It repeatedly uses power to poke targets, each poke reducing power by distance `M`. Each successful poke counts as one. If power reaches exactly half of the initial power and dividing it by exhaustion factor `Y` is possible (integer division), do so once. Continue poking until power is less than `M`. Print remaining power and count of pokes.

---

### 📝 Task 11: Snowballs  
You will receive `N` snowballs, each with snow amount, time, and quality. Calculate snowball value as `(snowballSnow / snowballTime) ^ snowballQuality`. Print the snowball with the highest value.

---

### 📝 Task 12: Data Type Finder  
Read inputs until receiving `"END"`. For each input, determine its data type among: Integer, Floating point, Character, Boolean, or String. Print the input and its detected type.

---

### 📝 Task 13: Compare Numbers from Left to Right  
Read an integer `N`. Then for `N` lines, read two numbers separated by space. For each pair, print the sum of digits of the greater number.

---

### 📝 Task 14: Floating Point Equality  
Read two floating-point numbers. Compare them with precision `eps = 0.000001`. Print if they are equal within this tolerance.

---

### 📝 Task 15: Prime Checker Refactor  
Given numbers from 2 to `N`, print if each is prime (`true` or `false`). Refactor the code for clarity and readability.

---

### 📝 Task 16: Message Decryption  
Given a key and `n` characters, add the key value to each character's ASCII code and form a decrypted message. Print the message.

---

### 📝 Task 17: Balanced Brackets  
Read `n` lines containing `'('`, `')'`, or other strings. Determine if brackets are balanced: no nested parentheses and every closing bracket has a matching opening bracket before it. Print `"BALANCED"` or `"UNBALANCED"` accordingly.

---

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
