# Associative Arrays – Programming Fundamentals with Python 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Associative Arrays** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. The original tasks were part of the C# curriculum, but here they are reimplemented in JavaScript as a way to practice and master the language. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

---

### 📝 Task 1: Count Real Numbers  
**Problem Description:**  
Read a sequence of integers from input. Then, print all unique numbers in ascending order, followed by how many times each number appears.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Odd Occurrences  
**Problem Description:**  
Write a program that finds all words from an input line that appear an odd number of times, ignoring case.

- Words are given on a single line, separated by spaces.  
- Output all such words in lowercase, preserving their original order of appearance.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Word Synonyms  
**Problem Description:**  
Create a program that stores synonyms in a dictionary. Each word maps to a list of its synonyms.

- You will receive a number `n` representing how many words you will input.  
- For each word, you will then receive one synonym (total `2 * n` lines).  
- If a word appears more than once, add the new synonym to its list.

**Output Format:**  
Print each word followed by its list of synonyms, separated by commas:  
`"{word} - {synonym1, synonym2, ..., synonymN}"`

### 📝 Task 4: Word Filter  
**Problem Description:**  
Given a list of strings, print only those whose length is an even number.  

Print each word on a new line.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
